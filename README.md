# Push to talk remapping keys to F13

All credit goes to [grismar](http://www.grismar.net/ventrilocapsfix/). This repo is simply to archive it and for me to save it to use for future reference in case his website ever goes down.

Please note:
I take no responsibility for any problems you may experience. Please use this at your own risk. These registry files are meant for Window machines only. Use at your own risk.

I have successfully remapped my Caps Lock key to F13 using grismar's reg files. Now with it being to F13, I no longer have to worry about the caps lock actually activating.


## How to use these files
1. Download whichever one you want to remap above to your desktop
2. Double click on the registry file and a popup will appear
3. Click yes to continue
4. Restart your machine (this step is important as it will take affect after restart)

To undo, download the undo all reg file.
